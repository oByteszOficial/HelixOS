# HelixOS

**HelixOS** is an intuitive Linux-based operating system designed for people who are just starting out in the Linux world. It's built to be simple, lightweight, and user-friendly.
This OS is based on **Ubuntu**, but at the same time it has a similar idea to ChromeOS, which natively runs Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), and unlike ChromeOS, it remains a complete Linux distro with support for normal apps.

## ✨ Features

- Clean and semi-customized GNOME-based interface
- Flatpak support out of the box
- GSConnect pre-installed for seamless smartphone integration
- Lightweight and optimized for older hardware

## 🖥️ System Requirements

- Dual-core CPU (2.1GHz or higher)
- 4GB of RAM (minimum)
- 30GB of free disk space

## 📦 Installation

HelixOS is distributed via pre-built ISOs. You can flash the ISO to a USB drive using tools like **Balena Etcher**, **Rufus**, or **dd**, then boot from it and follow the on-screen instructions.
