# HelixOS PWA Manager
# (this is an another name for "Navigator that runs PWA without have a big topbar")
# I don't know what this thing have to do, and how I have to call it
# I'm good with python, but I don't know how to made a "navigator" with it
# I'm trying to do this 'cause the newest version of HelixOS File Explorer (DNA Explorer) is a PWA
# And the navigator (currently Firefox Nightly) has a REALLY big topbar
# So I want to make a navigator that runs PWA without have a big topbar, like a "webview"
# Or like Google does this with ChromeOS, an operating system that is based on Linux but runs PWAs
# I want to do something similar to this in HelixOS

# I think I need a psychologist, I'm talking to myself inside a python code
# I DEFINITELY need a psychologist
# So here is the code

# I'm thinking that I will use ChatGPT to do this, so...
